Estimate geoadditive spatial or spatio-temporal semiparametric PS-SAR regression models.

Estimation and inference of spatial and spatio-temporal semiparametric models including spatial or spatio-temporal non-parametric trend, 
parametric and non-parametric covariates and, possibly, a spatial lag for the dependent variable. The spatio-temporal trend can be 
decomposed as an ANOVA function including main and interaction functions. Use of SAP algorithm to estimate the spatial or spatio-temporal 
trend and non-parametric covariates.
Some additional functions are provided to plot non-parametric functions, compute direct and indirect effects,... 
Examples are included in the code.
